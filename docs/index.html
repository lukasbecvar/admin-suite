            <section id="tech-stack" class="fade-in">
                <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
                <p>The Admin Suite is engineered with a robust and efficient tech stack, prioritizing performance,
                    stability, and ease of deployment. A key architectural decision was to design the application for
                    bare-metal deployment rather than as a containerized solution. This approach minimizes overhead,
                    provides direct access to server resources, and simplifies the operational footprint, making it
                    exceptionally straightforward to install and manage without the complexities often associated with
                    container orchestration.</p>
                <p>At its core, the application leverages PHP 8+ (specifically Symfony, as identified from the GitHub
                    repository analysis) for its powerful backend logic and API functionalities. For data persistence,
                    the metrics component and other critical data are stored in a MySQL database, chosen for its
                    reliability, widespread adoption, and robust feature set. Furthermore, the application utilizes the
                    filesystem for caching mechanisms instead of external solutions like Redis, further reducing
                    external dependencies and simplifying the overall system architecture. This streamlined approach
                    ensures that Admin Suite remains lightweight, highly performant, and easy to maintain.</p>

                    deploying any standard PHP project. Follow these detailed steps to get your Admin Suite up and
                    running:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><b>Download the Release archive:</b> Fetch the latest <code>admin-suite-&lt;tag&gt;.tar.gz</code>
                        release assets on the <a href="https://github.com/lukasbecvar/admin-suite/releases" target="_blank">GitHub Releases</a>
                        page, upload it to your server, and extract it to the directory. If you prefer working
                        directly with the source, you can clone it via HTTPS instead:
                        <pre><code>git clone https://github.com/lukasbecvar/admin-suite.git</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Configure Web Server:</b> Set up an Apache Virtual Host or Nginx server block to point to the
                        application's <code>public/</code> directory. This configures your web server to serve the Admin
                        Suite application.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Create Environment File:</b> Duplicate the <code>.env.prod</code> file to <code>.env</code>
                        in the root directory of the project. This file will contain your specific environment
                        configurations, such as database credentials and application settings. Customize it according to
                        your server environment.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Install Dependencies:</b> Navigate to the project root in your terminal and install both
                        frontend and backend dependencies using the respective package managers:
                        <pre><code>npm install && composer install</code></pre>
                        This command will install all required Node.js packages for frontend assets and PHP packages
                        managed by Composer.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Build Frontend Assets:</b> Compile the frontend assets (CSS, JavaScript) for production. This
                        step ensures that all styles and scripts are optimized and ready for deployment:
                        <pre><code>npm run build</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Create Database:</b> Create the necessary database for the Admin Suite. This command will
                        create the database if it doesn't already exist, based on your <code>.env</code> configuration:
                        <pre><code>php bin/console doctrine:database:create --if-not-exists</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Migrate Database:</b> Apply all pending database migrations to set up the required tables and
                        schema. The <code>--no-interaction</code> flag ensures the process runs non-interactively:
                        <pre><code>php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction</code></pre>
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Create Systemd Service for Monitoring:</b> For continuous monitoring, it is crucial to set up
                        a systemd service that runs the monitoring console command in an infinite loop. Refer to the
                        <code>systemd-config</code> documentation within the repository for detailed instructions on
                        configuring this service.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Create Main Admin User:</b> Establish the initial administrator account. You can do this
                        either via a console command or through the web interface. The web interface will automatically
                        allow user creation if the user table is empty, guiding you through the process.
                    </li>
                    <li><b>Configure Custom Suite Settings:</b> Optionally, create your custom suite configuration files
                        in the application's root directory. These files allow you to override default settings and
                        tailor the Admin Suite to your specific operational needs. Refer to the <a
                            href="#configuration">Configuration</a> section for more details.
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </section>

            <!-- configuration -->
            <section id="configuration" class="fade-in">
                <h2>Configuration</h2>
                <p>The Admin Suite offers flexible configuration options, allowing you to tailor its behavior to your
                    specific environment and operational requirements. Configuration is primarily managed through
                    environment variables and dedicated suite configuration files.</p>
                <h4>Environment Variables</h4>
                <p>Environment variables are crucial for defining sensitive settings and environment-specific parameters
                    without hardcoding them into the application. These variables are loaded from the <code>.env</code>
                    file located in the root directory of your project. You should create this file and populate it with
                    your unique configurations, such as database connection strings, API keys, and other critical
                    settings. This approach ensures that sensitive information is kept separate from the codebase and
                    can be easily managed across different deployment environments (e.g., development, staging,
                    production).</p>

                    <h4>Suite Configuration Files</h4>
                    <p>In addition to the environment variables, Admin Suite relies on JSON configuration files that
                        live in the <code>config/suite</code> directory. Each file governs a focused portion of the
                        system and can be overridden by copying it into the project root (for example
                        <code>protected-columns.json</code>) and editing the copy there. The application automatically
                        prefers the custom file while leaving the default variant untouched, which makes upgrades safe
                        and keeps your changes easily trackable.</p>
                    <p>Available suite configuration files:</p>
                    <p><b>protected-columns.json</b> — Array of database column names that the Table Browser must hide
                        completely. Add fields that carry credentials (e.g., <code>authentication_string</code>,
                        <code>auth_token</code>) to keep them obscured from exports and screenshots.</p>
                    <p><b>blocked-usernames.json</b> — Array of reserved usernames. During registration the backend
                        matches the chosen username against this list to prevent creation of accounts such as
                        <code>root</code>, <code>administrator</code>, etc. Extend it with any internal-only aliases.</p>
                    <p><b>feature-flags.json</b> — Key/value map of booleans that toggle whole components. Each property
                        name matches a module (e.g., <code>monitoring</code>, <code>terminal</code>, <code>database-manager</code>);
                        set it to <code>true</code> to expose the component in the UI or <code>false</code> to hide it.</p>
                    <p><b>package-requirements.json</b> — Defines what the diagnostic command checks for. It contains two
                        arrays:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>php-extensions</code>: Extension names such as <code>pdo_mysql</code>, <code>gd</code>
                            or <code>intl</code>.</li>
                        <li><code>system-packages</code>: Binaries that should be present on the host (e.g.,
                            <code>composer</code>, <code>ufw</code>, <code>git</code>, <code>zip</code>). The Requirements
                            check command iterates over both arrays and reports missing dependencies.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>services-monitoring.json</b> — Master definition of every monitored service. It is a map where
                        each key is an internal identifier and the value describes the service:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>service_name</code>: Unique slug used in logs and API calls.</li>
                        <li><code>display_name</code>: Human friendly label rendered on the dashboard.</li>
                        <li><code>type</code>: Either <code>systemd</code> (checked via <code>systemctl</code>) or
                            <code>http</code> (polled via HTTP requests).</li>
                        <li><code>monitoring</code>/<code>display</code>: Toggle whether the service is actively checked
                            and/or shown in the UI without deleting the definition.</li>
                        <li><code>config_files</code>: List of files to expose in the detail drawer so operators can open
                            related configuration from the UI.</li>
                        <li><code>url</code> (HTTP only): Endpoint to call; <code>accept_codes</code> holds the HTTP
                            status codes that count as healthy; <code>max_response_time</code> expresses the SLA in
                            milliseconds.</li>
                        <li><code>metrics_monitoring</code>: Nested object with <code>collect_metrics</code> boolean and
                            <code>metrics_collector_url</code> string. When enabled, Admin Suite fetches custom metrics
                            from the provided URL.</li>
                        <li><code>exception_file</code>: Absolute path to the log file that should be tailed inside the
                            monitoring UI (optional for purely systemd services).</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>terminal-aliases.json</b> — Object where each key is the alias exposed in the in-browser
                        terminal and the value is the exact command executed (e.g., <code>ll</code> →
                        <code>ls -alF -v</code>). Updating this file lets you roll out helper shortcuts to all operators.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>terminal-blocked-commands.json</b> — Array of commands that the terminal will refuse to run.
                        Add resource-heavy or destructive binaries (<code>bpytop</code>, <code>vim</code>, etc.) to keep
                        the shared environment safe.</p>
                    <p>Any change to these files is picked up immediately; you only need to clear cache if you modify
                        them while running in production with long-lived opcache.</p>

                    handles user registration, login, and permission management, providing a tailored experience that
                    integrates perfectly with the application's functionalities.</p>
                <p>A unique aspect of the initial setup is that only the very first user attempting to register through
                    the application's web interface will be granted administrative privileges. This mechanism ensures a
                    secure initial deployment, preventing unauthorized access during the critical setup phase.
                    Subsequent user registrations can then be managed and assigned roles by the primary administrator.
                </p>
                <p>For user sessions, the Admin Suite utilizes standard PHP sessions, ensuring secure and stateful
                    interactions. Additionally, a 'remember me' feature is implemented using secure cookies, allowing
                    users to maintain their login status across browser sessions for enhanced convenience, while
                    adhering to best practices for secure cookie handling.</p>
                <p>Machine-to-machine integrations can reuse any user’s authentication token as an API key. Sending the
                    token in the <code>API-KEY</code> HTTP header automatically hydrates the session, so the request
                    inherits the same permissions as if the user had logged in via the UI. API access must be explicitly
                    allowed per user (the <code>allow_api_access</code> flag), and tokens can be rotated from the Users Manager
                    module. Every API-key authentication attempt is logged under the
                    <code>api-authentication</code> channel for auditing.</p>

            <!-- monitoring -->
            <section id="monitoring" class="fade-in">
                <h2>Monitoring</h2>
                <p>The Admin Suite provides a comprehensive and flexible monitoring system designed to keep you informed
                    about the health and performance of your server and its services. It encompasses various monitoring
                    facets, from service uptime to detailed system metrics and visitor tracking for web applications.
                </p>
                <h4>Services Monitoring</h4>
                <p>The core of the service monitoring functionality relies on a dedicated console command
                    (<code>console app:monitoring:process</code>) that runs continuously in an infinite loop. This
                    command actively checks the status of both HTTP-based services and systemd services. For robust
                    operation, this command should be configured to run as a persistent systemd service on your server.
                </p>
                <p>Monitored services are meticulously defined within the
                    <code>config/suite/services-monitoring.json</code> configuration file, allowing for granular control
                    over what is monitored. To ensure timely alerts, it is essential to configure the monitoring
                    interval and specify an SMTP server or push notification settings via environment variables. The
                    real-time status and historical monitoring data for all configured services are then intuitively
                    displayed on the web dashboard page, providing a clear overview of your infrastructure's health.</p>
                <h4>Metrics Collection</h4>
                <p>The metrics component is an integral part of the monitoring process, designed to collect and store
                    vital performance data. Its operation is directly tied to the running monitoring process, ensuring
                    continuous data capture. This component diligently records average usage values for critical system
                    resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage, based on the interval defined in your <code>.env</code>
                    file (<code>METRICS_SAVE_INTERVAL</code>). This historical data is invaluable for analyzing
                    long-term performance trends, identifying bottlenecks, and planning resource allocation.</p>
                <h4>Metrics Collector for HTTP Services</h4>
                <p>For web applications, the Admin Suite offers a specialized Metric Collector, enabling you to gather
                    custom metrics directly from your monitored HTTP services. This feature allows for a deeper insight
                    into application-specific performance indicators. You can easily enable the metric collector within
                    the <code>services-monitoring.json</code> file by setting <code>collect_metrics</code> to
                    <code>true</code> and specifying the <code>metrics_collector_url</code>. The Metric Collector is
                    designed to accept simple key-value pairs (<code>key</code> as a string, <code>value</code> as an
                    integer or float), making it highly adaptable for various custom metrics.</p>
                <h4>Example Response from the Metric Collector URL:</h4>
                <pre><code>{
  "cpu_usage": 64,
  "ram_usage": 77,
  "storage_usage": 10,
}</code></pre>
                <p>This example demonstrates how your application can expose its internal metrics for collection by the
                    Admin Suite.</p>
                <h4>Visitor Tracking</h4>
                <p>The visitor tracking feature provides valuable insights into the usage of your HTTP-based services.
                    It allows you to monitor visitor activity, helping you understand user engagement and traffic
                    patterns. To activate this feature, you need to configure the specific service within the
                    <code>services-monitoring.json</code> file. It's crucial to specify both the service name and its
                    URL (the URL is used for verification against the <code>HTTP_ORIGIN</code> header).</p>
                <p>Tracking is performed via a simple API call that needs to be integrated into your web application's
                    frontend. Below is an example of how to implement this API call using JavaScript:</p>
                <pre><code>const visitorReferer = document.referrer || 'Unknown'

fetch('https://admin-suite.url/api/monitoring/visitor/tracking', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        service_name: 'monitored-service-name',
        referer: visitorReferer
    })
})</code></pre>
                <p>This snippet demonstrates how your web application can send visitor data to the Admin Suite for
                    comprehensive tracking and analysis.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- notifications -->
            <section id="notifications" class="fade-in">
                <h2>Notifications</h2>
                <p>The Admin Suite ensures that administrators are always informed about critical events and system
                    statuses through a robust notification system. This system is designed to deliver timely alerts,
                    allowing for proactive management and rapid response to potential issues.</p>
                <p>Notifications are primarily delivered through two channels:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Web Push Notifications:</b> For immediate, in-browser alerts, the application supports web
                        push notifications. Administrators can enable these directly within their user settings,
                        ensuring they receive real-time updates and critical alerts even when not actively browsing the
                        Admin Suite dashboard. This provides a seamless and persistent notification experience.</li>
                    <li><b>Email Alerts:</b> In addition to web push, the system is capable of sending detailed alerts
                        directly to the administrator's email address. This serves as a reliable fallback and a
                        comprehensive record of significant events, such as service outages, critical system errors, or
                        security warnings. Email notifications can be configured to provide detailed context, helping
                        administrators quickly understand and address the reported issues.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The flexibility of these notification methods ensures that administrators can choose their preferred
                    way to stay updated, guaranteeing that no critical event goes unnoticed.</p>
            </section>

            <!-- logging -->
            <section id="logging" class="fade-in">
                <h2>Logging</h2>
                <p>The Admin Suite incorporates a comprehensive logging system designed to provide deep insights into
                    both internal application activities and external events. This dual-purpose logging capability is
                    crucial for auditing, debugging, and maintaining a secure and transparent operational environment.
                </p>
                <p>The system facilitates two primary types of log storage, both managed efficiently within the
                    database:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>User Action Tracking:</b> All significant actions performed by Admin Suite users are
                        meticulously recorded in the database. This includes login attempts, configuration changes,
                        command executions, and any other administrative operations. This detailed audit trail is
                        invaluable for security analysis, accountability, and understanding user behavior within the
                        application.</li>
                    <li><b>External Application Logs via API:</b> The Admin Suite provides a dedicated API endpoint that
                        allows external applications to send their logs directly to the suite's centralized logging
                        system. This feature enables you to consolidate logs from various services and applications into
                        a single, easily searchable repository. By centralizing logs, administrators can gain a holistic
                        view of their entire ecosystem, simplifying troubleshooting, performance analysis, and security
                        incident response across their infrastructure.</li>
                </ul>
                <h4>External Log API</h4>
                <p>External services can push events to <code>POST /api/external/log</code>. The endpoint
                    accepts simple query parameters (<code>name</code>, <code>message</code>, <code>level</code>)
                    or an <code>application/xml</code> payload with the same fields. Each call must include a valid <code>API-KEY</code> header that belongs
                    to a user with API access enabled.</p>
                <pre><code>curl -X POST https://admin-suite/api/external/log \
  -H "API-KEY: &lt;user-token&gt;" \
  --data-urlencode "name=backup-service" \
  --data-urlencode "message=Backup finished in 142s" \
  --data-urlencode "level=4"</code></pre>
                <p>Successful return a JSON confirmation, while missing fields, malformed XML, or invalid
                    credentials generate descriptive error responses so callers can react immediately.</p>
                <p>By storing logs directly in the database, the Admin Suite ensures data integrity, facilitates complex
                    querying, and provides a persistent record of all events, making it an indispensable tool for system
                    administrators.</p>

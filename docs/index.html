            <section id="tech-stack" class="fade-in">
                <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
                <p>The Admin Suite is engineered with a robust and efficient tech stack, prioritizing performance,
                    stability, and ease of deployment. A key architectural decision was to design the application for
                    bare-metal deployment rather than as a containerized solution. This approach minimizes overhead,
                    provides direct access to server resources, and simplifies the operational footprint, making it
                    exceptionally straightforward to install and manage without the complexities often associated with
                    container orchestration.</p>
                <p>At its core, the application leverages PHP 8+ (specifically Symfony, as identified from the GitHub
                    repository analysis) for its powerful backend logic and API functionalities. For data persistence,
                    the metrics component and other critical data are stored in a MySQL database, chosen for its
                    reliability, widespread adoption, and robust feature set. Furthermore, the application utilizes the
                    filesystem for caching mechanisms instead of external solutions like Redis, further reducing
                    external dependencies and simplifying the overall system architecture. This streamlined approach
                    ensures that Admin Suite remains lightweight, highly performant, and easy to maintain.</p>

                </ol>
            </section>

            <!-- configuration -->
            <section id="configuration" class="fade-in">
                <h2>Configuration</h2>
                <p>The Admin Suite offers flexible configuration options, allowing you to tailor its behavior to your
                    specific environment and operational requirements. Configuration is primarily managed through
                    environment variables and dedicated suite configuration files.</p>
                <h4>Environment Variables</h4>
                <p>Environment variables are crucial for defining sensitive settings and environment-specific parameters
                    without hardcoding them into the application. These variables are loaded from the <code>.env</code>
                    file located in the root directory of your project. You should create this file and populate it with
                    your unique configurations, such as database connection strings, API keys, and other critical
                    settings. This approach ensures that sensitive information is kept separate from the codebase and
                    can be easily managed across different deployment environments (e.g., development, staging,
                    production).</p>
                <h4>Suite Configuration</h4>
                <p>Beyond environment variables, the Admin Suite utilizes a system of JSON-based suite configuration
                    files to manage various application-specific settings. The default configurations are stored in the
                    <code>config/suite</code> directory. A powerful feature of the Admin Suite is its ability to allow
                    you to override these default configurations by creating your own custom configuration files
                    directly in the application's root directory. This provides immense flexibility, enabling you to
                    customize behaviors without modifying the core application files.</p>
                <p>Key suite configuration files include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>config/suite/blocked-usernames.json</code>: A comprehensive list of usernames that are
                        reserved or blocked from being registered within the Admin Suite, enhancing security and
                        preventing conflicts.</li>
                    <li><code>config/suite/package-requirements.json</code>: Defines a list of required system packages
                        and PHP extensions that the Admin Suite depends on for full functionality. This file is crucial
                        for diagnostic checks and ensuring all prerequisites are met.</li>
                    <li><code>config/suite/services-monitoring.json</code>: This file is central to the monitoring
                        capabilities, specifying the services (HTTP, systemd) that the Admin Suite should actively
                        monitor, along with their respective health check parameters and alert thresholds.</li>
                    <li><code>config/suite/terminal-aliases.json</code>: Allows you to define custom command aliases for
                        the integrated terminal component, streamlining frequently used commands and improving
                        efficiency for administrators.</li>
                    <li><code>config/suite/terminal-blocked-commands.json</code>: A critical security feature that lists
                        commands that are explicitly blocked from execution within the integrated terminal, preventing
                        potentially dangerous operations.</li>
                </ul>
                <div class="phone-none">
                    <h4>Environment variables</h4>

                <h2>Authentication</h2>
                <p>The Admin Suite employs a meticulously designed, completely custom user authentication system, built
                    from the ground up to ensure robust security and seamless user management. This bespoke system
                    handles user registration, login, and permission management, providing a tailored experience that
                    integrates perfectly with the application's functionalities.</p>
                <p>A unique aspect of the initial setup is that only the very first user attempting to register through
                    the application's web interface will be granted administrative privileges. This mechanism ensures a
                    secure initial deployment, preventing unauthorized access during the critical setup phase.
                    Subsequent user registrations can then be managed and assigned roles by the primary administrator.
                </p>
                <p>For user sessions, the Admin Suite utilizes standard PHP sessions, ensuring secure and stateful
                    interactions. Additionally, a 'remember me' feature is implemented using secure cookies, allowing
                    users to maintain their login status across browser sessions for enhanced convenience, while
                    adhering to best practices for secure cookie handling.</p>

                <p>The Admin Suite application is designed with a strong focus on security to protect sensitive data and

                <ul>
                    <li><b>High-Level Data Encryption:</b> Sensitive data stored in the database is encrypted using AES

                    <li><b>XSS Protection:</b> The application incorporates various protections against Cross-Site
                        Scripting (XSS) attacks, sanitizing user inputs and outputs to mitigate common web
                        vulnerabilities.</li>
                    <li><b>Production Environment Checks:</b> Includes checks to prevent running in production
                        environments without SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) enabled, ensuring encrypted communication.</li>
                    <li><b>Robust Authentication:</b> Utilizes a custom, secure user management system with strong
                        password handling and session management.</li>

                <p>The Admin Suite provides a comprehensive and flexible monitoring system designed to keep you informed
                    about the health and performance of your server and its services. It encompasses various monitoring

                <h4>Services Monitoring</h4>
                <p>The core of the service monitoring functionality relies on a dedicated console command
                    (<code>console app:monitoring:process</code>) that runs continuously in an infinite loop. This
                    command actively checks the status of both HTTP-based services and systemd services. For robust
                    operation, this command should be configured to run as a persistent systemd service on your server.
                </p>
                <p>Monitored services are meticulously defined within the
                    <code>config/suite/services-monitoring.json</code> configuration file, allowing for granular control
                    over what is monitored. To ensure timely alerts, it is essential to configure the monitoring
                    interval and specify an SMTP server or push notification settings via environment variables. The
                    real-time status and historical monitoring data for all configured services are then intuitively
                    displayed on the web dashboard page, providing a clear overview of your infrastructure's health.</p>
                <h4>Metrics Collection</h4>
                <p>The metrics component is an integral part of the monitoring process, designed to collect and store
                    vital performance data. Its operation is directly tied to the running monitoring process, ensuring
                    continuous data capture. This component diligently records average usage values for critical system
                    resources such as CPU, RAM, and storage, based on the interval defined in your <code>.env</code>
                    file (<code>METRICS_SAVE_INTERVAL</code>). This historical data is invaluable for analyzing
                    long-term performance trends, identifying bottlenecks, and planning resource allocation.</p>
                <h4>Metrics Collector for HTTP Services</h4>
                <p>For web applications, the Admin Suite offers a specialized Metric Collector, enabling you to gather
                    custom metrics directly from your monitored HTTP services. This feature allows for a deeper insight
                    into application-specific performance indicators. You can easily enable the metric collector within
                    the <code>services-monitoring.json</code> file by setting <code>collect_metrics</code> to
                    <code>true</code> and specifying the <code>metrics_collector_url</code>. The Metric Collector is
                    designed to accept simple key-value pairs (<code>key</code> as a string, <code>value</code> as an
                    integer or float), making it highly adaptable for various custom metrics.</p>
                <h4>Example Response from the Metric Collector URL:</h4>
                <pre><code>{
  "cpu_usage": 64,
  "ram_usage": 77,
  "storage_usage": 10,
}</code></pre>
                <p>This example demonstrates how your application can expose its internal metrics for collection by the
                    Admin Suite.</p>
                <h4>Visitor Tracking</h4>
                <p>The visitor tracking feature provides valuable insights into the usage of your HTTP-based services.
                    It allows you to monitor visitor activity, helping you understand user engagement and traffic
                    patterns. To activate this feature, you need to configure the specific service within the
                    <code>services-monitoring.json</code> file. It's crucial to specify both the service name and its
                    URL (the URL is used for verification against the <code>HTTP_ORIGIN</code> header).</p>
                <p>Tracking is performed via a simple API call that needs to be integrated into your web application's
                    frontend. Below is an example of how to implement this API call using JavaScript:</p>
                <pre><code>const visitorReferer = document.referrer || 'Unknown'

fetch('https://admin-suite.url/api/monitoring/visitor/tracking', {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
        'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        service_name: 'monitored-service-name',
        referer: visitorReferer
    })
})</code></pre>
                <p>This snippet demonstrates how your web application can send visitor data to the Admin Suite for
                    comprehensive tracking and analysis.</p>
